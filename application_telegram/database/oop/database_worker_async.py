        Initializes the DBWorkerAsync instance with an asynchronous database engine.

        This constructor method sets up a DBWorkerAsync instance by assigning an asynchronous SQLAlchemy engine

        important to provide a properly configured asynchronous SQLAlchemy engine compatible with the target database.

        Parameters:
            engine (SQLAlchemy Async Engine): An asynchronous SQLAlchemy Engine object that provides connectivity
        to the database.

        Returns:
            None: This method does not return anything. It initializes the DBWorkerAsync instance.
